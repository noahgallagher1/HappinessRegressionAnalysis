My Findings

    I learned that the most important factors that contributes to a person’s happiness is Freedom.
      The more Freedom a country has, the more likely we can expect to find happy citizens.

    The second most important factor in happiness is Family.
      The more Family and loved ones a person has, directly contributes to the person’s overall happiness.
